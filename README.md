  Right To Counsel NYC Coalition's Worst Evictors Website
</h1>

This repository contains the Right To Counsel (RTC) NYC Coalition's Worst Evictors Website.

It is based on a [Gatsby starter](https://github.com/fhavrlent/gatsby-contentful-typescript-starter). Almost all of the content is pulled from [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/).

Read about the Housing Data Coalition's code of conduct on our [About Page](https://www.housingdatanyc.org/). 


## ðŸš€ Quick start

1. **Set Contentful API keys.**

  Copy **`.env.sample`** to **`.env`** and set your Contentful API variables. To grab these variables, make an account and create a content space with [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/). 

2. **Install dependencies.**

  Run `yarn` to install all dependencies.

3. **Start developing.**

  Run `yarn develop` to start developing.

  Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

  *Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).*

4. **Edit some files!**

  Open the the repository's root directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.tsx`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
